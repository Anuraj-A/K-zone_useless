# K-zone_Patrol üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: K-Zone


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anuraj A - Dep. IT, Kannur University Campus, Mangattuparamba

### Project Description
K-Zone Patrol is an AI-powered diagnostic tool that analyzes images of road potholes. Instead of providing a useful solution, it classifies the pothole into a humorous category, giving drivers a name for their pain without actually helping them.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every day, drivers across Kerala encounter countless potholes. The real issue isn't the damage to their vehicles, but the emotional distress caused by not knowing how to properly categorize their suffering. Was it a minor inconvenience or a major threat to their car's well-being? This lack of a clear, useless diagnosis leads to unnecessary anxiety.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We provide a web-based platform where users can upload a photo of a pothole. Our advanced computer vision algorithm then analyzes the image and provides an instant, pseudo-scientific classification, such as "Tyre-Guzzler" or "Suspension Smasher," allowing drivers to finally label their frustration accurately.
